# 🚀 Fundamentals of Programming Project

Welcome to our **Fundamentals of Programming** project!  
In this capstone project, we will design and implement a simple interpreter 
for a Python. The project will focus on creating and supporting 
a minimal subset of the language, with an emphasis on basic constructs like 
variables, arithmetic, conditionals, and iterative control flow. The interpreter 
will be capable of executing simple algorithms, serving as a proof of its functionality.

## 🛠️ Project Goals
- Build an interpreter in Java for Python-like syntax.  
- Implement essential features:  
	- Variable assignment.  
	- Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %).  
	- Conditional statements (if, else).  
	- Iterative control flow (while loops).  
	- Basic input and output.
- Ensure the interpreter is simple, correct, and detects syntax errors.

### 🚚 Deliverables
1. **Language Subset Specification**:  
   A concise document defining the subset syntax and features.
   
2. **Interpreter Implementation**:  
   A working interpreter capable of parsing and executing the subset.
   
3. **Test Algorithms**:  
   Code examples for simple algorithms executed successfully by the interpreter.
   
4. **Documentation**:  
   A user guide describing how to use the interpreter, including sample programs.
