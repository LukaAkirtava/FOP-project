# Contributors

This project is the result of a collaborative effort by the following team members. Each member contributed unique skills and worked on sometimes different aspects of the codebase to bring this Python-like interpreter to life but most of the times we worked together on the same code to produce better result.

### **Luka Akirtava (Team Leader)**  
- Oversaw project direction and scope, coordinated tasks!
- Implemented and worked on the `Interpreter`,`Main`,`TokenType` classes,

### **Luka Khurtsidze**

- contributed in Main class

### **Levan Lekvinadze**

### **Davit Meshvelashvili**

### **Team Effort**  
- All members participated in debugging and resolving important issues.  
- Every contributor reviewed others' code to ensure quality and offer suggestions.  
- Discussions about project goals and iterative improvements were equally shared among all.  
- Big classes functions like `Interpreter`,`Lexer`,`Main` was implemented by all members equally we worked via calls or gathering or alone, thus it hard to say who did what because everyone was part of it 

We are proud of what we have achieved together and hope this project serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in interpreters!
